title: nordlicht - create colorful barcodes from video files
---

> <img src="/images/nordlicht-logo.png">
> **nordlicht** is a tool that converts video files into colorful barcodes. nordlicht is free software, supports a large number of styles, and is optimized for speed. It comes with a software library written in C that allows for easy integration into other programs.

## Examples

<div class="nordlicht"><a href="/images/lion-king.png"><img src="/images/lion-king.png"></a><p>The Lion King (1994)</p></div>
<div class="nordlicht"><a href="/images/nemo.png"><img src="/images/nemo.png"></a><p>Finding Nemo (2003)</p></div>
<div class="nordlicht"><a href="/images/titanic.png"><img src="/images/titanic.png"></a><p>Titanic (1997)</p></div>

Even if you don't know the movies, you can probably spot the fire scene in The Lion King, the dirty fish tank scene in Finding Nemo, and the sinking scene in Titanic. You can also see the credits, and spot outdoor scenes (which feature a blue sky in the upper half).

nordlicht creates these images by taking the movies' frames in regular intervals, scaling them to 1 pixel width, and putting next to each other.
